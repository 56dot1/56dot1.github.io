								<h2>Undergraduate level</h2>
								<p>Henan University&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachelor of Software Engineering(Excellence Program)
								<br>GPA:3.51/4.0 &nbsp;&nbsp; Average Score:87.32/100&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Ranking 48/388</p>
								<p>During my undergraduate studies, my research focused on isolated word recognition in Chinese Sign Language. I was responsible for developing the sign language recognition model within a team. After trying Yolov5 and MediaPipe models, I used the I3D model with optical flow to perform the sign language recognition task. Our project proposed a new method for recognizing isolated words in Chinese Sign Language, and by relying on the pre-trained I3D model, we re-created its top network layer, allowing for better classification of sign language (the new top network layer improved recognition accuracy by approximately 43% compared to the pre-trained model's top network layer). The following figure shows a demo of the model.</p>

								<p>As one of the longest projects I have spent in my undergraduate studies, it has brought me and our team one computer software copyright on Chinese sign language recognition, and a national project and closed with 'excellent' results in the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training for University of PRC. In addition to the first place, it also brought us a provincial competition honor and two school-level competition honors. </p>
								
								<p>During my four years at Henan University, I have won a total of <b>four provincial-level awards</b>, 
								<b>three university-level awards</b>, and multiple department-level awards in various academic competitions. 
								Among these awards are the <b>Provincial First Prize in China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling</b>. 
								The university awards include the <b>Henan University Scholarship</b>, <b>Merit student of Henan University</b>, 
								<b>Henan University Individual Scholarship</b>, <b>Excellent Graduation Thesis</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Outstanding Graduate of Henan University</b> .</p>
								
								<h2>Graduate level</h2>
								<p>I will do my best to improve this section in the next two years of study.ðŸ˜³</p>

							<h2>About the photo</h2>
							<p>The photo was taken in June 2021, when our team had just been established and we were discussing some details of the project proposal. At that time, none of us could have imagined that over the next two years, we would become important partners to each other in our undergraduate lives.</p>
